# Wren: Your AI Motivational Coach via WhatsApp

This project aims to build an AI-powered motivational coach that users can interact with via WhatsApp. It leverages the Twilio API for messaging and the OpenAI API for generating motivational responses.

## Project Roadmap & Future Enhancements:

This project is currently a prototype with the following planned enhancements:

1.  [ ]**WhatsApp Integration**: Transition from basic SMS support to full WhatsApp messaging capabilities.
    1.  Implementing whatsapp with twilio seems like a hassle. I'm going to find some alternatives for whatsapp bots.
    2.  It seems like Meta developers may be a way to go. 
2.  [ ]**Advanced Agentic Features**: Incorporate more sophisticated agentic functionalities beyond a basic chat client.
    2.  I'm also thinking about adding image capabilities. Seems to be already covered by the API. 
    3.  Wait, but that just turns it into a multimodal agent designed for a specific purpose and gets closer to a chatbot. 
    4.  What are things your coach does for you, other than just chat? 
        1.  Your coach can help you set goals. 
        2.  Your coach can help you track your progress. 
        3.  Your coach can help you celebrate your milestones. 
    5.  I'm thinking of adding planning and habit building abilities. 
    6.  I'm thinking of adding scheduling capabilities.
3.  [ ]**Persistent Memory**: Migrate conversation memory from local file storage to a robust database solution, enabling advanced search and recollection features.
    1.  I'm thinking about adding a vector database to store embeddings of conversations. 
    2.  I'm also thinking about adding a vector database to store embeddings of goals. 
    3.  I'm also thinking about adding a vector database to store embeddings of actions. 
    4.  I'm also thinking about adding a vector database to store embeddings of events. 
    5.  I'm also thinking about adding a vector database to store embeddings of notes. 
    6.  I'm also thinking about adding a vector database to store embeddings of reminders.
